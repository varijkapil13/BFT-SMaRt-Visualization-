## Visualization Library

The files here are part of the visualization library. 
To use them with the servers. Start the Systemstatics python file, and Kafka Consumer. This will start a web server on whatever port you have mentioned in Kafka Consumer file. Make sure to keep these files in the same folder as Kafka Consumer.

After Kafka Consumer is started, simply go to the url of the machine your Kafka Consumer is hosted on, with the port number of the server. for example, if Kafka Consumer is on `192.168.1.1`, and the port specified is `:8080`, goto [192.168.1.1:8080](http://192.168.1.1:8080) to view the visualization.
